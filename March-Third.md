### The evolution of knowledge and current state of spatial knowledge management systems

## Goal
It's crucial to maintain your second brain, writing your own thoughts and notes, to grow your own independent knowledge tree.

## Problem
All the notes are currently fragmented across many websites, social network comments, blog posts, Notion documentation, Trello boards, real-time data in sport news and blockchain block explorers, etc.

> Interestingly, fragmentation of information is exact problem the internet was originally supposed to solve.
The original MeMex Machine was designed to upload all the written books into a interwingled shared digital stretch-text space visually revealing innate interconnections of meanings across all the books.
